# Hi there, I'm Sean 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Marketing. I've been in the tech industry for 13 years and I'm currently working at [Smol AI](https://github.com/smol-ai/) as a Software Engineer.

I'm passionate about building software that helps people and makes a difference in the world. I think AI has the potential to change the world for the better and I'm excited to be a part of that change.

Some of my favorite AI projects I've worked on are:
